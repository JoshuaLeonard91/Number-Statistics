# Number Statistics Program

## Overview
This project demonstrates the understanding of basic programming structures, the use of methods, and the utilization of built-in Java classes. The program provides statistical insights into a list of numbers entered by the user.

## Objective
- Practice fundamental programming concepts and structures.
- Develop skills in using methods and built-in Java classes.
- Implement a menu-driven application for performing various statistical operations on a list of numbers.

## Description
The **Number Statistics Program** prompts the user to input a list of numbers separated by spaces and then displays a menu with the following options:

### Options:
1. **Display List Statistics**  
   - Outputs:
     - Minimum
     - Maximum
     - Count
     - Range
     - Median
     - Mean
     - Mode
     - Population Variance
     - Population Standard Deviation

2. **Display List Ordered**  
   - Prints the list in ascending order using the `Arrays` class.

3. **Count Number of Even/Odd**  
   - Counts and displays the number of even and odd numbers in the list.

4. **Count Number of Primes**  
   - Counts and displays how many numbers in the list are prime.

5. **Enter New Number List**  
   - Allows the user to input a new list of numbers separated by spaces.

6. **Quit Program**  
   - Exits the program. The program continues to run until this option is selected.

## Implementation
- Each menu option has at least one associated method to handle its functionality.
- Supporting methods are used to break down complex operations (e.g., for calculating statistics in the "Display List Statistics" option).

## Features
- **User-Friendly Menu**: The program uses a menu-driven approach to guide the user through available options.
- **Built-In Java Classes**: Leverages Java's `Arrays` class for sorting.
- **Reusable Code**: Methods are modular and reusable to ensure clean and maintainable code.
- **Dynamic Input**: Users can input a new list of numbers dynamically without restarting the program.

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher**
